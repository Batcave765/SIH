## Turning community screenshots into disaster solutions

NeerSuraksha is a crowd-sourced disaster management application focused on water-related issues. The platform collects data from social media sources, such as Twitter, and provides real-time reports for swift action.

## Features

- **Crowd-Sourced Data**: Utilizes social media platforms to gather information on water-related problems reported by users.
- **Real-Time Reporting**: Provides immediate notifications about incidents reported by users.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to identify the severity and type of water-related problems reported.
- **React Native Application**: Built using React Native framework for cross-platform compatibility and a native mobile app experience.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design to encourage easy reporting and interaction from users.

## How It Works

NeerSuraksha utilizes social media platforms' APIs to scrape data related to water-related incidents. This data is then processed using machine learning algorithms to identify the severity and type of each problem reported. The machine learning models categorize incidents based on various parameters such as location, keywords, images, and user descriptions.

Once categorized, the incidents are prioritized based on severity and relayed to government officials through real-time reporting mechanisms. This application aims to streamline the process of disaster management by providing accurate and timely information for efficient decision-making and intervention.

By combining social media scraping, machine learning techniques, and the cross-platform capabilities of React Native, the app ensures that water-related issues are promptly addressed, thereby mitigating the impact of disasters on communities.
